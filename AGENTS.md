# Repository Guidelines

## Product Direction

This repository is now **Galactic Wars: Clone Wars**, a licensed Star Wars fan mod and a first-hand battle simulator. The player should remain physically present in the world: fighting beside recruited troops, issuing orders on the battlefield, building and supplying bases, assigning workers, and travelling with squads. Use Villager Recruits and Ancient Warfare as high-level behavioral references for embodied NPC command, logistics, and settlement play—not as code or asset sources. Favor playable in-world interactions over detached grand-strategy screens or menu-only automation. Army, economy, progression, planet, vehicle, and Force systems should reinforce this recruit-command-build-fight loop.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Java 25 NeoForge mod. Production code lives in `src/main/java/galacticwars/clonewars`, grouped by gameplay domain such as `army`, `combat`, `faction`, `kingdom`, `progression`, `settlement`, `world`, and `workforce`. Mod metadata is generated from `src/main/templates`; assets, datapacks, mixins, models, textures, and localization belong under `src/main/resources`. Keep new resource and registry paths namespaced with `galacticwars`. Test harnesses mirror production packages in `src/test/java`; runtime GameTests live in `src/main/java/galacticwars/clonewars/gametest`. Design history is stored in `docs`; older Middle-earth plans are historical context, not current product direction. Treat `build/`, `.gradle/`, and `run/` as generated local state.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use the checked-in Gradle wrapper (Windows examples shown):

- `.\gradlew.bat build` compiles sources, processes resources, and runs the standard verification lifecycle used by CI.
- `.\gradlew.bat runHarnesses` runs all dependency-light executable test classes and is included in `check`/`build`.
- `.\gradlew.bat runClient` launches a development Minecraft client.
- `.\gradlew.bat runServer` starts a local server with `--nogui`.
- `.\gradlew.bat runData` regenerates data into `src/generated/resources`.
- `.\gradlew.bat runGameTestServer` launches NeoForge GameTests when registered.

Unix-like environments should use `./gradlew` instead.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow the existing Java style: four-space indentation, UTF-8, braces on the declaration line, and one public top-level type per file. Use `UpperCamelCase` for classes and records, `lowerCamelCase` for methods and variables, and lowercase package names. Prefer small domain types and immutable value objects. Name resource files and registry identifiers in lowercase `snake_case`; keep Java packages aligned with their directories. No formatter or linter is configured, so match nearby code and keep imports organized.

## Testing Guidelines

Most tests are dependency-light executable classes named `*Test.java`, with a `public static void main` and explicit assertions; they are not JUnit tests. Add them beside the matching domain package and print `<ClassName> passed` on success. Use GameTests for Minecraft runtime behavior that pure harnesses cannot prove. Run focused harnesses while iterating, then `.\gradlew.bat build`; run `.\gradlew.bat runGameTestServer` for entity AI, menus, combat, travel, persistence, or world interaction changes. Do not describe a catalog, policy, or source-presence test as completed gameplay until its player-facing runtime path is wired and tested.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use short, imperative subjects such as `Add atomic squad planet travel` and `Add playable blaster heat and ranged AI`. Keep each commit focused. Pull requests should explain player-facing behavior and scope, list verification commands, and include screenshots for GUI, model, or texture changes. Clearly distinguish playable runtime features from data/model foundations and deferred milestones. Ensure CI’s Java 25 Gradle build passes.

## Licensing & Source Use

Follow `NOTICE.md` and keep GPL-derived historical code GPL-3.0-only compatible. The project is authorized to use Star Wars IP for this mod, so do not reject Star Wars names, concepts, or official assets solely because they are franchise material. Only add official material covered by the project's license or other documented permission, and record its source and authorization. Original art and writing must remain provenance-tracked. Do not import unlicensed third-party mod code or assets; treat Villager Recruits, Ancient Warfare, and `talhanation/recruits` only as behavioral references unless explicit compatible permission exists.
