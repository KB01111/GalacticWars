# Galactic Wars Asset Provenance

## 2026-07-12 planetary refinement and lightsaber expansion

Four placeholder-grade planetary materials were replaced with separately generated, original source
textures retained under `tools/source_art`. Each source was prompted as an orthographic seamless pixel-art
material without logos, symbols, characters, text, or recognizable franchise motifs. The reproducible
`tools/generate_polished_textures.py` pass fits each source to 16x16, reduces it to a controlled 24-color
palette, and equalizes opposite edge texels after reduction so the final block tiles are seamless.

| Final asset | Retained source | Built-in generation result | Material direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `textures/block/coruscant_panel.png` | `generated_coruscant_panel_source.png` | `exec-7f40e704-5b4d-4895-9b7f-05b33363505e.png` | Dark modular infrastructure plating with cyan conduits and sparse amber indicators. |
| `textures/block/kamino_panel.png` | `generated_kamino_panel_source.png` | `exec-63a419ba-8326-4190-be53-d2a8e5a75ba1.png` | Pearl ceramic-alloy research panel with cool seams and icy-blue lighting. |
| `textures/block/geonosis_rock.png` | `generated_geonosis_rock_source.png` | `exec-3a2b65a9-fad3-4df5-9ae3-a92784d8d52a.png` | Iron-rich rust sediment with ochre strata and restrained basalt fragments. |
| `textures/block/tatooine_sand.png` | `generated_tatooine_sand_source.png` | `exec-213d0bac-de93-47cd-be73-efe2afd201cb.png` | Pale wind-combed desert sand with warm mineral flecks. |

Purple, yellow, and white lightsabers were generated as separate straight-beam energy-saber concepts on
a flat green key. The accepted sources are retained beside chroma-cleaned cutouts; the first purple draft
was rejected because its broad fantasy-sword silhouette did not meet the lightsaber brief. The installed
16x16 inventory icons are fitted from the accepted cutouts. Six matching 3D-model material sets use
project-authored hilt patterns and four-frame animated blade strips generated deterministically from the
accepted palettes.

| Final icon | Retained accepted source | Built-in generation result | Hilt direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `textures/item/purple_lightsaber.png` | `generated_purple_lightsaber_source.png` | `exec-fe3667ee-8cae-465e-96f2-9bfb75bfe26e.png` | Blackened silver with a violet emitter ring. |
| `textures/item/yellow_lightsaber.png` | `generated_yellow_lightsaber_source.png` | `exec-16c22aaf-699d-4819-b86c-f92258a025dd.png` | Weathered gunmetal, dark grip, and amber activation stud. |
| `textures/item/white_lightsaber.png` | `generated_white_lightsaber_source.png` | `exec-a4a0ae86-20ba-4ed3-aaa9-665456ddce18.png` | Brushed silver, black grip bands, and pearl-blue activation light. |

The installed image-generation helper removed each flat green background using border key sampling, a
soft matte, thresholds 12/220, and despill. Final cutouts have transparent corners, non-empty visible
coverage, and no green key background. No official art, film stills, logos, or third-party mod assets were
used.

## Polished clone, droid, and lightsaber pass

The detailed Clone Trooper, B1 Battle Droid, and lightsaber direction was generated with the built-in image generation workflow as project-owned concept material. Because general image generation does not preserve Minecraft cube UV coordinates, `tools/generate_polished_textures.py` translates that direction into deterministic UV-safe 64x64 GeckoLib skins and native 16x16 item sprites. The existing Gondorian-derived clone/droid geometry, bone names, pivots, animations, and UV origins remain unchanged; only the texture pixels are replaced.

All assets listed here are original, project-bound artwork. No official Star Wars artwork, film stills, logos, third-party mod textures, or other third-party assets were used.

## Equipped armor and complete NPC model pass

The twenty recruit/civilian models and five equipped armor families are generated together by
`tools/generate_character_models.py`. Recruit cuboids retain non-overlapping 128x128 box UVs.
Equipped armor instead uses explicit six-face mappings on 1024x1024 atlases at six texture texels per
model unit, allowing recessed seams, bevel lighting, controlled wear, vents, fasteners, woven fibers,
and family-specific plate markings without changing the player-space geometry scale. The script also
produces the five civilian spawn-egg asset sets that were previously missing. The resulting geometry adds
separate helmet shells, visors, chest and back plates, pauldrons, gauntlets, belts, pouches, knee and
shin guards, boots, droid joints, robes, hoods, packs, sensors, and profession details while retaining
the animation and held-item bone contract.

The armor silhouette pass used the project-owned inventory sheet
`tools/source_art/generated_armor_icons.png` as its palette input and the built-in image-generation
result `exec-ec4c1511-f614-4799-8051-f0f34a0dcd67.png` as a generic voxel-material reference. A copy
is retained at `tools/source_art/generated_armor_model_reference_v2.png`. The prompt explicitly
required new generic science-fantasy designs, neutral mannequins, and no characters, logos, emblems,
weapons, or existing-franchise imagery. Final distributable models and UV atlases are deterministic
script output rather than crops or copied pixels from the reference sheet.

After the initial equipped textures failed visual review for flat, low-density surfaces, a second
project-owned material study was generated from the five existing inventory icons. It is retained as
`tools/source_art/generated_armor_material_reference_v3.png`. That study established the final material
language: off-white layered plastoid, blackened bronze alloy, weathered teal plate, black woven cloth
with crimson lacquer, and brushed silver beskar. No pixels from the study are shipped directly; the
generator translates those material decisions into exact per-face GeckoLib UV regions.

## Method

- Generated source images with the built-in OpenAI image-generation tool on 2026-07-11.
- Used one focused prompt per deliverable. Opaque blocks were generated edge-to-edge; inventory and UI art used a flat `#ff00ff` chroma background.
- Fitted sources to the manifest dimensions with nearest-neighbor resampling. Chroma pixels were removed locally using a conservative magenta color threshold because the bundled Pillow helper was unavailable in the active runtime.
- Validated exact dimensions, opaque/transparent pixel contracts, non-empty visible coverage, distinct SHA-256 hashes, and visual readability at native resolution.
- Beskar ore, raw Beskar, and the Beskar ingot were transformations of the project's own Mithril-derived artwork, then substantially recolored and redrawn by the generator.

## Shared prompt constraints

Every prompt required crisp Minecraft-readable pixel art with hard pixel clusters, no antialiasing, text, logos, faction insignia, watermarks, or official Star Wars imagery. Transparent assets additionally required a uniform `#ff00ff` background, no shadows, and no magenta in the subject.

## Core batch

| Final asset | Generated source | Asset-specific prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `textures/block/command_center_side.png` | `exec-cf5ea313-ba97-411e-bd6e-d3ba22beef63.png` | Armored charcoal duracrete side panel with inset gunmetal plating, amber status light, and restrained cyan circuit accents. |

Generated sources remain in the Codex image-generation store for auditability. The distributable sources of truth are the final PNGs under `src/main/resources/assets/galacticwars/`.

## Remaining manifest batches

- `factions`: identity chips, five armor layer sets, and armor inventory icons.
- `combat_and_tools`: complete; all seventeen icons and their item/model references are installed and validated.

## Unit batch

The fifteen 64x64 entity textures use generated character concepts only as palette, silhouette, and material references. Final distributable atlases are deterministically authored into the exact cube-face regions declared by the locked GeckoLib models under `assets/galacticwars/geckolib/models/entity/`; model-specific and shared humanoid base regions are opaque, while remaining atlas space is transparent.

### UV validation correction

The initial geometry-only transparency mask cleared `hutt_enforcer.png` pixel `16,31`, which belongs to the canonical body-west face. The atlas was regenerated with the shared head, body, arm, and leg UV boxes always preserved in addition to geometry-specific boxes. The corrected pixel now uses the surrounding authored body material and is fully opaque. `RecruitTextureAtlasTest` subsequently validated required face opacity, bounds, dimensions, animation references, alpha-safe atlases, and distinct unit texture hashes for all fifteen units.

## Combat and tools partial batch

Each completed source was fitted to 16x16 with nearest-neighbor resampling, cleaned to a transparent inventory background, and linked through matching item-definition and handheld-model JSON files.

| Final icon | Generated source |

| `textures/item/e5_blaster.png` | `exec-24cfabe0-11a5-457e-9475-cc4b4bafcec0.png` |

The project-owned Mandalorian ingot texture and both resource references were renamed from `mandalorian_alloy_iron_ingot` to the registered `mandalorian_alloy_ingot` identifier without altering the artwork.

### Consolidated source-sheet mapping

The remaining nine icons came from the generated 3x3 source sheet `exec-aeab48fc-acaa-441f-ac1f-4329e9681096.png`. Each equal cell was cropped independently, nearest-neighbor fitted to 16x16, and chroma-cleaned.

| Cell | Final icon |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1, column 1 | `textures/item/westar_blaster.png` |
| Row 1, column 2 | `textures/item/scatter_blaster.png` |
| Row 1, column 3 | `textures/item/nightsister_bow.png` |
| Row 2, column 1 | `textures/item/blue_lightsaber.png` |
| Row 2, column 2 | `textures/item/green_lightsaber.png` |
| Row 2, column 3 | `textures/item/red_lightsaber.png` |
| Row 3, column 1 | `textures/item/blaster_bolt.png` |
| Row 3, column 2 | `textures/item/force_light.png` |
| Row 3, column 3 | `textures/item/force_dark.png` |

All seventeen combat/tool textures passed the final contract audit: exact 16x16 dimensions, transparent corners and backgrounds, non-empty visible subjects, zero visible chroma pixels, seventeen distinct SHA-256 hashes, and resolving `assets/galacticwars/items` plus `models/item` references.

## Faction batch

Faction inventory art came from `exec-f7a0bd99-9610-42b1-ae4e-8c0a7d07113b.png`. The 5x5 sheet maps columns left-to-right to `republic`, `separatist`, `mandalorian`, `hutt_cartel`, and `nightsister`; rows top-to-bottom map to `identity_chip`, `helmet`, `chestplate`, `leggings`, and `boots`. Every cell was independently center-cropped, nearest-neighbor fitted to 16x16, and chroma-cleaned to its corresponding `textures/item/{faction}_{row}.png` path.

The adult, baby, and leggings layers were recolored from project-owned UV-safe armor templates using the same generated faction palettes, preserving transparency and exact vanilla armor UV positions. Their paths are `textures/entity/equipment/{humanoid|humanoid_baby|humanoid_leggings}/{faction}.png` and are connected by `equipment/{faction}.json`.

Validation passed for all forty faction PNGs: twenty-five unique 16x16 inventory hashes, five distinct textures within each armor-layer class, exact 64x32 adult/leggings and 64x64 baby dimensions, non-empty transparency and visible coverage, zero residual chroma, resolving item/model references, and five complete equipment descriptors.

## Planets batch

The four planet-selection icons and navigation console were generated on a uniform magenta background, nearest-neighbor fitted to their final GUI dimensions, and chroma-cleaned to transparent PNGs. The four environment materials were generated as opaque edge-to-edge square sources and nearest-neighbor fitted to 16x16.

| Final asset | Generated source |

| `textures/block/tatooine_sand.png` | `exec-816bfdcc-02d5-4cd9-b055-c6f9f75b31ab.png` |
| `textures/block/geonosis_rock.png` | `exec-22c00903-b5eb-4149-aaf2-fdbf62e194fb.png` |
| `textures/block/kamino_panel.png` | `exec-b198b307-3f5c-4cbb-93d0-951a9add76bd.png` |
| `textures/block/coruscant_panel.png` | `exec-c18810f8-3243-4f27-8c78-eb4bf14882fb.png` |
| `textures/gui/navigation_console.png` | `exec-a25927d5-7c63-42b7-b4ea-5ee435fe099b.png` |

The completed planet gate passed exact-dimension and alpha checks: every planet icon is 128x128 with transparent corners, the navigation console is 256x256 with a transparent exterior and center, every block is fully opaque at 16x16, all transparent assets have non-empty visible coverage and zero residual magenta, and all nine PNGs have distinct SHA-256 hashes. Each environment block has resolving blockstate, block-model, item-definition, and item-model JSON references.

## Vehicle batch

Each vehicle began as a separately generated, edge-to-edge material kit containing original armor, engine, cockpit, joint, and weapon panels. The sources were nearest-neighbor fitted to 256x256 and copied only into the explicit cuboid face footprints declared by the matching GeckoLib geometry. All unused atlas space remains transparent.

| Final atlas | Generated material source | Geometry and animation contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `textures/entity/vehicle/barc_speeder.png` | `exec-367b9f7b-bcd4-4d68-9bd8-4d6fe21f7a9b.png` | `geckolib/{models,animations}/entity/vehicle/barc_speeder.*.json` |
| `textures/entity/vehicle/at_rt.png` | `exec-79a66d46-f2c3-4b78-8bf1-0a2648066303.png` | `geckolib/{models,animations}/entity/vehicle/at_rt.*.json` |
| `textures/entity/vehicle/stap.png` | `exec-456e75ae-c89e-4219-adbc-0aeb9ab753f7.png` | `geckolib/{models,animations}/entity/vehicle/stap.*.json` |
| `textures/entity/vehicle/aat.png` | `exec-b2870082-c235-4546-90d9-86eaf1b8aa2c.png` | `geckolib/{models,animations}/entity/vehicle/aat.*.json` |
| `textures/entity/vehicle/laat_gunship.png` | `exec-66e0e323-af49-443e-905e-fabcb722cb43.png` | `geckolib/{models,animations}/entity/vehicle/laat_gunship.*.json` |

Validation parsed every geometry and animation file, resolved parent and animated bone references, verified the `geometry.galacticwars.vehicle.*` identifiers and 256x256 declarations, and recalculated every box-UV footprint from its cube dimensions. All footprints are in bounds, non-overlapping, and fully opaque; every atlas also retains transparent unused space and a transparent corner. The five final PNGs have distinct SHA-256 hashes and passed native-resolution visual inspection.

The first LAAT audit identified a six-pixel-high overlap between the right-cannon and side-door footprints. The right-cannon origin was moved from `[112,128]` to `[112,168]`, the atlas was rebuilt from the same generated source, and the complete five-vehicle validation was rerun successfully after the correction.

## Effects and GUI batch

All six sources were generated on a uniform magenta background, visually reviewed together, cropped to their visible subject bounds, nearest-neighbor fitted with transparent padding to the exact manifest dimensions, and chroma-cleaned.

| Final asset | Generated source |
| --- | --- |
| `textures/particle/blaster_bolt.png` | `exec-b2c405e5-d86c-4d93-b888-80bbe178b103.png` |
| `textures/particle/force_wave.png` | `exec-5f00564a-979f-4c9c-9328-db2f39440d2a.png` |
| `textures/gui/quest_panel.png` | `exec-676222e1-84eb-4415-8d78-9ea53164ffc9.png` |
| `textures/gui/conquest_panel.png` | `exec-50d1b8b8-1f44-4178-a59f-45dd11189f74.png` |
| `textures/gui/vehicle_hud.png` | `exec-cf7dc42c-3058-4cd7-88d2-056246f19579.png` |
| `textures/gui/force_meter.png` | `exec-b0ddd5b5-edf8-46b4-a8da-87d793538ace.png` |

The particle sprites resolve through `particles/blaster_bolt.json` and `particles/force_wave.json`; GUI textures are direct named resources for their render layers. Validation passed exact sizes, transparent corners and interiors, non-empty visible coverage, zero residual chroma, six distinct SHA-256 hashes, JSON/reference resolution, and native-resolution readability.

## Armor icon refinement

The twenty armor inventory icons were regenerated as one cohesive project-owned pixel-art sheet (`exec-35cea704-fd2a-43e4-a596-d48046a7341d.png`). The retained source is `tools/source_art/generated_armor_icons.png`; `tools/generate_polished_textures.py` removes its flat green key, isolates the fixed five-by-four cells, fits each silhouette into a transparent 16x16 canvas, and writes the helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots icons for all five armor families. This keeps the small in-game assets reproducible while preserving distinct Republic plastoid, Separatist alloy, Mandalorian alloy, Nightsister weave, and Beskar material language.
