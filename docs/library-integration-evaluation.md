# Optional Library Evaluation

Evaluated 2026-07-12 against the mod's current Minecraft 26.2 / NeoForge 26.2 target.

## Decision Summary

| Library | Current fit | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yet Another Config Lib (YACL) | Version 3.9.5 has a NeoForge 26.2 artifact whose embedded metadata requires Minecraft and NeoForge `[26.2,26.3)`. The five existing `ModConfigSpec` values benefit from clearer categories, descriptions, reset controls, and an accessible configuration screen. | Implemented as an external client dependency. YACL edits the existing NeoForge values and `galacticwars-common.toml` remains authoritative; no second config format was introduced. |
| Curios API | A strong domain fit for future utility belts, holocrons, scanners, jetpacks, and other wearable equipment. The official API supplies compatible, data-driven equipment slots without adding slots by default. Its current 26.x release is a 26.1.2 beta rather than a verified 26.2 build. | Design future wearable items behind a small internal equipment abstraction, then integrate Curios when the first wearable mechanic is implemented and a 26.2 build is available. Do not make it a dependency yet. |
| Resourceful Lib | A 26.2 / 5.0.1 artifact is available, but the current code does not need its resource-pack/highlight helpers or another general utility layer. It would add a runtime dependency without replacing an existing subsystem. | Do not add. Reconsider only when a concrete Team Resourceful API feature replaces code we would otherwise maintain. |

## Integration Guardrails

- Keep NeoForge `ModConfigSpec` as the source of truth. The YACL screen binds directly to those values and saves the existing common config.
- Keep Curios optional at the design boundary. Core combat, Force, army, and settlement systems must not require an accessory mod to load.
- Add third-party libraries for a named player-facing feature, not as speculative infrastructure.
