# Runtime and Visual QA

This checklist is the repeatable creative-world acceptance pass for player-facing
Galactic Wars content. Run it with the built JAR in the GDLauncher NeoForge 26.2
instance and YACL plus GeckoLib enabled.

## 2026-07-20 NPC and clone-armor overhaul

- `tools/generate_character_models.py` was run twice after the source import and every character
  output hash remained identical. `tools/render_character_previews.py` produced
  `build/previews/recruit_models.png` and `build/previews/armor_models.png` for native-resolution review.
- `runHarnesses`: passed all 136 tasks, including mixed-resolution 22-NPC geometry, signed per-face
  UV bounds, source-pixel equality, named silhouettes, bone parents, animation references, registry,
  item, recipe, provenance, and manifest gates.
- `buildAll`: passed all 144 tasks for Fabric and NeoForge.
- `runGameTestServer`: all 55 required tests passed. Both Phase I entities and
  spawn eggs loaded their unit data and complete armor loadouts; Phase I hiring
  satisfied the generic clone campaign objective, persisted, and joined the
  Republic outpost profile.
- Development client: resource reload completed after the permissioned import with GeckoLib reporting
  35 models and 35 animations. `neoforge/run/logs/latest.log` contains no Galactic Wars missing-model,
  missing-texture, missing-animation, GeckoLib parser, or renderer-loading error.
- Visual review: Phase I/II helmets, regular/ARC equipment, Forge-derived B1 silhouette, and four
  Galaxies-derived Mandalorian loadouts are distinguishable in the generated preview. The preview
  renderer does not evaluate every hierarchical animation or held-item transform.
- Interactive arena captures for all 22 front/side/back and first/third-person
  armor views remain a manual release check; Windows exposed duplicate,
  indistinguishable GLFW windows to the automation controller, so no visual
  pass is claimed here.

## Automated gates

- `clean build`: passed on 2026-07-14.
- `runGameTestServer`: 55/55 required GameTests passed, including direct
  Command Center player interaction, all five campaign paths, NPC brains,
  vehicles, Force abilities, multiplayer authority, travel, and persistence.
- Spawn eggs: all 22 registry entries passed player-game-mode interaction,
  entity-type component, persistence, loadout/archetype, creative/survival,
  replaceable-block, custom-name, stack-consumption, and spawner checks.
- Assets: every authored item model has a modern item definition and every
  inherited model texture resolves to a PNG.
- Client log: no `galacticwars` missing-model or missing-texture warning.

## Command Center client acceptance

The 2026-07-14 fresh creative-world pass used a 571x350 client window to stress
the responsive layout. The Command Center rendered with its directional model,
opened the five-faction pledge screen on placement, committed a Galactic
Republic pledge, and reopened into the synchronized operations dashboard.

- Overview, Campaign, Construction, Squads, Workforce, Kingdom, Diplomacy, and
  Storage tabs rendered and remained usable at the small viewport.
- Multi-page action controls advanced and returned without overlapping the
  dashboard frame.
- Campaign Chapter 1 showed the pledged and Command Center requirements as
  complete and named the physical Clone Trooper hiring objective.
- World save, integrated-server shutdown, and client exit completed cleanly.
- Labels found too long during the pass were shortened before the final build.

## Lightsaber acceptance

The six colors inherit one seventeen-part hilt/blade geometry and override only the
hilt and animated blade textures. The first-person extension preserves the
vanilla hand transform and adds only the ready/slash offset.

The rebuilt visual language was developed from the original project-owned
reference in `lightsaber-design-reference.png`, generated for this repository
on 2026-07-13. The shipped 32-pixel material atlases are deterministic original
pixel art produced by `tools/generate-lightsaber-textures.ps1`; no third-party
mod textures or geometry are included.

| Context | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creative inventory/GUI | Pass | `lightsaber-gui.png` |
| First person | Pass | `lightsaber-first-person.png` |
| Third person | Recheck after pose/transform changes | Capture front and back |
| Dropped item | Recheck on a clear stone floor | Capture after one animation cycle |
| Item frame | Recheck on a plain wall | Capture fixed transform |

## Content audit order

Use daylight, a plain stone floor, hitboxes off, and the same camera distance.
Capture idle, walk, attack/held-item, and seated views where applicable.

1. NPCs: all 22 egg variants; verify body scale, seams, surfaces, held items,
   armor, idle/walk/attack clips, and neutral ownership.
2. Vehicles: BARC speeder, AT-RT, STAP, AAT, and LAAT gunship; verify kit icon,
   deployed model, collision box, rider seat, and animation.
3. Weapons and armor: all lightsabers, blasters, tools, and faction armor.
4. Blocks and kits: command/logistics blocks, beacons, transponders, deployment
   kits, and environmental blocks in GUI, placed, dropped, and framed views.

Any missing `galacticwars` model/texture line in `latest.log` is a release
failure, even if Minecraft substitutes a fallback model.
